    "Just like any other languages, computer language is one that we use to communicate with the computer. Knowing how the programming language will allow us to better communicate with the computer so that they can perform the task you want to perform. Python has been increasingly popular due to the availability of many open libraries that are already developed and ready to be imported for us to use and their relatively simpler syntaxes. Like any other languages, Python has its own set of rules. Among all the other programming languages, the syntaxes of Python is considered easier to understand and is more beginner friendly."
